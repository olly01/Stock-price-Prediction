## Overview

### Description
This project is a web-based stock price prediction application built using Dash, Keras, and other Python libraries. The application allows users to input a stock symbol, select a date range, and specify the number of epochs, batch size and sequence length for training an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The predicted stock prices are visualized along with additional information such as company details and real-time stock information.

### Features
- **Stock Data Fetching:** Utilizes the Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`) to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Performs data preprocessing, including the calculation of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and scaling of data.
- **LSTM Model Training:** Constructs and trains an LSTM model using the Keras library.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface with Dash for inputting parameters and viewing predictions.
- **Real-time Stock Information:** Retrieves real-time stock information using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **ChatBox:** Allows the user to converse with a Chat bot regarding any queries they have.

### Functionality
- **Fetching Data**
    - **fetch_data(symbol, start_date, end_date):** Fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API for the specified stock symbol and date range.
    - **fetch_company_data(symbol):** Fetches company information for the specified stock symbol.

- **Preprocessing Data**
    - **preprocess_data(stock_data, sequence_length):** Preprocesses the fetched data by scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.

- **Model Building and Training**
    - **build_model(sequence_length):** Builds an LSTM model with the specified sequence length.
    - **train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs, batch_size):** Trains the LSTM model on the training data.

- **Prediction and Visualization**
    - **predict_data(model, X_test):** Generates predictions based on the trained model.
    - **inverse_transform(scaler, data):** Inverse transforms scaled data to its original form.
    - **get_stock_info(symbol):** Shows real-time stock information for the specified symbol.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- numpy
- yfinance
- dash
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- openai

Install the packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy yfinance dash tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib openai
```
Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "key"
```
*If you don't have a key, you can obtain one here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys <br>
*You must have an active OpenAI API balance to use this software <br>
If you have any issues with path length while setting up Tensorflow,
run the following command on Windows PowerShell:
```bash
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" `
-Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

### How to run
To run the application, simply run the main script:
```python
py main.py
```
The application will start a local server and you can view the application by navigating to ```http://127.0.0.1:8050/``` in your web browser.

### Usage
Dash Application
The Dash application provides a user interface for interacting with the model:
1. Enter a stock symbol in the input field.
2. Select a date range using the date picker.
3. Specify the number of epochs, batch size and sequence length for model training.
4. Click the "Search" button to view the stock price predictions and enable the AI-powered chatbot.

### Notes
Ensure a stable internet connection to fetch real-time stock information.<br>
Some stock symbols may not be available or may have limited past data.<br>
Adjusting the number of epochs may affect the model's accuracy and training time.
